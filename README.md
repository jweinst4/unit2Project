Most of my time spent on this project was implementing functionality.  Given more time,I would have probably added additional functionality for 4-7 days, then would focus on styling.  I would probably look for creative inspiration and make a minimalistic styled webpage.

I would also try to implement a scroll button for each of the clothing items that shows a preview of the next 3 or 4 items in the database.  I would also try to push the most recent added clothing item to the current outfit area which wouldnt take too long.

I would also want to include a list of generic t-shirt and jean options such that the user wouldnt have to include links to their own.  In addition, if I could come up with a way to autoamtically remove a background from a URL input that would be beneficial to the user.

I would also want to include clothing recommendations based on the color of the items chosen, i.e. if you input black pants it may recommend a white shirt.  I would also include a section for belts and other accessories.

I would also want to include a preview pane on the show page such that the current outfit can be seen from the show page.

I would also add login and password authentication given more time.
